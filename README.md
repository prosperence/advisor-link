# Advisor Link
The idea of advisor link is to create a platform where financial advisors can connect with clients and potential clients. It helps users find the right advisor, maintain healthy communication with them, and it helps advisors manage their clients.

### Services For Financial Advisors (and their clients)
* Streamline communicate between advisors and their clients
  * Scheduling (share calendar, schedule without tedious back and forth)
  * Integrated secure, compliant messaging and file sharing
  * Reminders for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.
  * E-signature support
* All licensed advisors will have a basic profile that simply shows their license and legal info. From there, advisors can create an account to add custom information and features.

### Services For Non-Advisors
* Users can search for advisors and see key information about them:
  * Where they work
  * If they're actually independent
  * What licenses they have and where they're licensed
  * Any complaints filed with FINRA
  * Ratings and reviews from current/former clients (must be verifiable)
* Non-Advisors can create profiles as well.
  * Can link with an advisor to open communication, scheduling, file sharing, etc.

### Forum
* Have a blog/forum section so that users can post questions that advisors (other users?) can answer.
* Questions and answers can be up/down voted, categorized, searched, etc.
